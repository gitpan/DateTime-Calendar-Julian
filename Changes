Revision history for Perl extension DateTime::Calendar::Julian.

0.02  2003-02-16
    - replaced POSIX::floor with a homegrown version

    - renamed _greg2rd and _rd2greg to _ymd2rd and _rd2ymd, in
      anticipation of a possible change in DateTime. The old names will
      still be available for a while for backward compatibility.

    - corrected the POD documentation on from_object (reported by Dave
      Rolsky)

    - removed some bugs in the test script (patch by Tatsuhiko Miyagawa)

    - perhaps most importantly, changed comment in t/1.t: -4712/1/1 is
      not JD 1, but JD 0

0.01  2003-02-14
	- original version; the methods that are inherited from DateTime are
	  not well tested yet
